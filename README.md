## How to Install

```
$ git clone git@github.com:hassiweb/OANDA-Chart-Viewer.git
```

## How to Run

### 1. Configure your OANDA account information

You need to modify your OANDA account information and related information in `./scripts/oanda.conf`.  There is a sample file at `./airflow/app/oanda.conf.sample`.

Parameters are as follows:
- `account_id`: OANDA account ID
- `access_token`: Personal access token which is issued by OANDA to use their APIs
- `environment`: "practice" or "live" (see [Interface OANDAâ€™s REST-V20](https://oanda-api-v20.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oanda-api-v20.html#the-client) in detail)
- `from_date`: Initializing the database from this date (in RFC3339 format).
- `timezone`: TZ database name (see [List of tz database time zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) in detail)
- `granularity`: OANDA defined time granularity. (see [CandlestickGranularity](https://developer.oanda.com/rest-live-v20/instrument-df/) in detail)
- `instruments`: A string containing the base currency and quote currency delimited by a "\_". If you want several pairs, you can write multiple pairs delimited by a ",".



### 2. Configure your InfluxDB information (optional)

If you want to use a specific InfluxDB server, you can change the configuration for InfluxDB server in `./airflow/app/influxdb.conf`.



### 3. Run docker-compose.yml

Let's start the services by the following command.

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```



### 4. Initialize and update the database

This application uses Apache Airflow to manage scripts to initialize and update charts.  Web UI is provided via "localhost:18080" as follow.

Once turning the switch of the "initialization" tasks on, this task is going to retrieve chart data from `from_data` which is specified in `oanda.conf`.  After that, please turn the switch off because this is not needed to run repeatedly.

By switching the "update" task on, this task is going to retrieve the latest chart data repeatedly.





### 5. Show candlestick charts

Let's open a browser and type "localhost:13000".  

You can see four pre-configured panels for "EUR_USD", "USD_JPY" and "EUR_JPY" pairs.  If you selected a different pair, you need to change settings.  

However, it is impossible to override the provisioned panels by an InfluxDB restriction.  Here available options will let you Copy JSON to Clipboard and/or Save JSON to file which can help you synchronize your dashboard changes back to the provisioning source (see [here](http://docs.grafana.org/administration/provisioning/) in detail).



### 6. Update charts (optional)

This application manages scripts to update the chart by Apache Airflow.

When opening the Web UI of "localhost:18080," 



## Components
- InfluxDB

  InfluxDB is used to store candle data and technical analysis data.

- Grafana with [Grafana Candlestick Panel](https://github.com/ilgizar/ilgizar-candlestick-panel) [(c)ilgizar](https://github.com/ilgizar)

  Grafana is used to show the data.  "Grafana Candlestick Panel" enables to show candlesticks on the Grafana panel.

- Python using OANDA APIs and [Technical Analysis (TA) Library in Pyhton](https://github.com/bukosabino/ta) [(c)bukosabino](https://github.com/bukosabino)

  Currently, there are two scripts.  One is to retrieve candle data from OANDA.  The other is to calculate technical analysis indicators using technical analysis library "TA".
